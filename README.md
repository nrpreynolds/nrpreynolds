### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Nathan and I am a student in aerospace engineering at Iowa State University. I am very passionate about space and space travel. Currently I don't have much free time, but what time I can spend relaxing I typically end up playing video games on my computer. I would like to learn how to code well so I can make useful things from scratch on my own. I enjoy doing DIY things.
